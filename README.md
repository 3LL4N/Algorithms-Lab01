Explanation:

Data for average case is done with k elements over j tests for each k. Higher j means higher accuracy for each k, but will take more time to run. Current numbers are arbitrary. Higher k will provide better data for graphing.

As strings take longer to sort than numbers, the number of j and k are decreased.

Graphs are done through native Excel trendlines, with additional input from Desmos (https://www.desmos.com/calculator), especially for functions with complexity n log n as Excel only supports log n trendlines. 

Best and worst case for merge sort don't have Desmos graphs because reaching a noticable trend in computation time takes several thousand elements, while Desmos tables used to graph the element count to computation time accepts only 1000 entries per table.
